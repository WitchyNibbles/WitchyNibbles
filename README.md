## 🖤 about me

I write backend code in Python.  
I enjoy untangling systems that should not still be alive.  
I like clean APIs, careful migrations, and software that behaves.

Currently:
- working with **Python**, **Django**, **FastAPI**
- slowly summoning **AI / LLM** knowledge
- building things that survive contact with reality

## 🕸️ philosophy
- boring code is good code
- tests are love letters to your future self
- legacy systems are just haunted houses with uptime requirements
